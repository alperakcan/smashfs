## 1. overview ##

smashfs is a read-only compressed filesystem for linux kernel.

supported compressions are:

* none
* gzip
* lzma
* lzo
* xz

a smashed filesystem has four main blocks

* super block

  stored as uncompressed, and holds the information about the filesystem.

* nodes table

  stored as compressed, and hold the information about filesystem items.

* blocks table

  stored as compressed, and holds the information about accessing data blocks.

* data blocks

  stored as compressed, and holds the actual data of filesystem items.

## 2. creating ##

a smashed filesystem is created with the tool <tt>mkfs.smashfs</tt>.

creating a smashed filesystem from source directory with:

    # mkfs.smashfs -s source_directory -o smashfs.fs -b 131072 -c xz -j 8 -d

command line options:

* -s / --source

  source file or directory

* -o / --output

  output file

* -b / --block_size

  data block size, default is <tt>1048576</tt> bytes

* -d / --debug

  enable debugging, can be used repeatedly to increase debug level

* -j / --jobs

  enable and set job count for multi-threaded compressing to decrease filesystem creation time,
  default is <tt>8</tt>

* -c / --compressor

  select compression library, default is <tt>none</tt>

* --no_group_mode

  disable group mode and use user mode to gain some space

* --no_other_mode

  disable other mode and use user mode to gain some space

* --no_uid

  disable uid and use 0 to gain some space

* --no_gid

  disable gui and use 0 to gain some space

* --no_ctime

  disable ctime and use filesystem creation time to gain some space

* --no_mtime

  disable mtime and use filesystem creation time to gain some space

* --no_padding

  disable padding to 4K to gain some space

* --no_duplicates

  disable duplicate file checking, will increase filesystem size.
  may be usefull for debugging purposes.

## 3. extracting ##

a smashed filesystem is extracted with the tool <tt>unfs.smashfs</tt>.

extracting a smashed filesystem to output directory with:

    # unfs.smashfs -s smashfs.fs -o output_directory -d

command line options:

* -s / --source

  source file or directory

* -o / --output

  output file

* -d / --debug

  enable debugging, can be used repeatedly to increase debug level

## 4. linux kernel ##

linux kernel has to be patched with <tt>smashfs-kernel.patch</tt>.

patching linux kernel is quite easy:

    # cd linux
    # patch -p0 < smashfs.kernel.patch

enable smashfs, and compression methods from kernel config

    * SmashFS - Smashed file system support
      * xz compression
      * lzo compression
      * lzma compression
      * gzip comression
